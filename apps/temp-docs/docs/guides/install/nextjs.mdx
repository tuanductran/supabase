The quickest way to start using Tailwind CSS in your Next.js project is to use the Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example. This will automatically configure your Tailwind setup based on the official Next.js example. If you'd like to configure Tailwind manually, continue with the rest of this guide.

### Create your project

Start by creating a new Next.js project if you don’t have one set up already. The most common approach is to use Create Next App.

```bash

npx create-next-app my-project
cd my-project

```

#### Install the Supabase library

We will install @supabase/supabase-js SDK via npm.

```bash

npm install supabase-js

```

### Create a table in the database

You may have already created a project in Supabase, if not, [create one](https://app.supabase.com/new/new-project).

Go to the [table editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/editor) in your project, and create a new table.
Call the table name `cities`, and add a column called `name` that is type `text`. Click save, and the table will be created.

In your new table called `cities`, create a `New row`, and in the `name` field, type in "London" (Or, any city name you like).
You can add in as many rows as you like before proceeding.

### Get your project keys

Go to the [api settings page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api) in your project.

You will need the `anonKey` and `url`

Now that we have the API credentials in place, let's create a helper file to initialize the Supabase client. These variables will be exposed on the browser, and that's completely fine since we have Row Level Security enabled on our Database.

```js
filename = utils / supabaseClient.js

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export const supabase = createClient(
  YOUR_ANON_KEY, // replace this with your project anon key
  YOUR_URL // replace this with your project url
)
```

</NumberSection>

### Select from your new database table

Now that we have a utility set up in our NextJS app, we can now use it to interact with our project

```js
filename = pages / index.js

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { supabase } from '../utils/supabaseClient'

export default function Home() {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState([])

  useEffect(async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('cities').select()
    if (error) {
      // handle error here
    }
    setCities(data)
  }, [])

  return (
    <ul>
      {cities.map((city) => (
        <li>{city.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```
